# Comprehensive Assessment: Students Management System (A, B, C)

## Overview
This project consists of three assessments that collectively demonstrate the implementation of a full-stack application for managing students, along with a multithreaded producer-consumer model. Each assessment focuses on a specific area:

1. **Assessment A**: Backend (Spring Boot API)
2. **Assessment B**: Multithreaded Producer-Consumer Model
3. **Assessment C**: Frontend (Vue.js Application)

---

## **Assessment A: Backend**

### Description
This is the backend service for the Students Management System. It provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on student data and uses an H2 in-memory database.

### Features
- RESTful endpoints for managing students.
- Integration-ready with a frontend application.
- Built with **Spring Boot** and **Spring Data JPA**.

### Technologies
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **H2 Database**

### API Endpoints
- **GET /students**: Retrieve all students.
- **GET /students/{id}**: Retrieve a student by ID.
- **POST /students**: Add a new student.
- **PUT /students/{id}**: Update a student's details.
- **DELETE /students/{id}**: Delete a student by ID.

### Setup and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```
2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Access:
   - API: `http://localhost:8080/students`
   - H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`

## **Assessment B: Multithreaded Producer-Consumer Model**

### Description
This is a Java application implementing a producer-consumer model using multithreading and a blocking queue. Producers generate tasks, and consumers process them, ensuring thread safety.

### Features
- Multiple producers and consumers.
- Thread-safe queue (`BlockingQueue`).
- Prevention of task duplication or loss.

### Technologies
- **Java 17**

### Classes
- **Task**: Represents a unit of work.
- **Producer**: Generates tasks and places them in the queue.
- **Consumer**: Processes tasks from the queue.
- **ProducerConsumerExample**: Main class to initialize and run producers and consumers.

### Setup and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd producer-consumer
   ```
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java ProducerConsumerExample
   ```

## **Assessment C: Frontend**

### Description
This is a Vue.js-based frontend application for the Students Management System. It interacts with the backend (Assessment A) to display, add, edit, and delete student records.

### Features
- Dynamic table for listing students.
- Forms for adding and editing students.
- Delete operation with confirmation.
- Seamless integration with the backend API.

### Technologies
- **Vue.js 3**
- **Axios** for API integration.

### Pages and Components
- **Home.vue**: Main page displaying student data.
- **StudentTable.vue**: Table component for listing students.
- **StudentForm.vue**: Form component for adding or editing students.
- **Header.vue**: Header with application title.
- **Menu.vue**: Sidebar for navigation.

### Setup and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Access the application at:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## **Integration Workflow**

### Frontend and Backend Communication
1. **Frontend**: The Vue.js application sends API requests to the backend using Axios.
2. **Backend**: The Spring Boot backend processes the requests and interacts with the database.
3. **Database**: Student data is stored in an H2 in-memory database (can be replaced with MySQL for persistence).

### Key API Workflow
- **Frontend sends requests**: 
  - `GET /students` to fetch student data.
  - `POST /students` to add a student.
  - `PUT /students/{id}` to update a student.
  - `DELETE /students/{id}` to delete a student.
- **Backend processes requests** and responds with the appropriate data.

---

## **Testing and Debugging**
1. **Backend Testing**:
   - Use Postman or `curl` to test API endpoints.
   - Access the H2 Console (`http://localhost:8080/h2-console`) to view or modify the database.

2. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Verify API integration by performing add, edit, delete operations.
   - Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to debug API requests.

3. **Producer-Consumer Testing**:
   - Run the producer-consumer application and verify task generation and consumption in the console logs.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Backend**:
   - Switch from H2 to MySQL for persistent data storage.
   - Add authentication and authorization.
   
2. **Frontend**:
   - Add validations and user feedback for form inputs.
   - Enhance the UI with a modern design framework like Vuetify or TailwindCSS.

3. **Producer-Consumer**:
   - Add graceful shutdown for producers and consumers.
   - Implement priority-based task processing.
